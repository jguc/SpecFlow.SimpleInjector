## Usage

Install plugin from NuGet into your SpecFlow project.

    PM> Install-Package SpecFlow.SimpleInjector
  
Create a static method somewhere in the SpecFlow project (recommended to put it into the `Support` folder) that returns an SimpleInjector `Container` and tag it with the `[ScenarioDependencies]` attribute. Configure your dependencies for the scenario execution within the method.

A typical dependency builder method probably looks like this:

    [ScenarioDependencies]
    public static Container CreateContainer()
    {
      // create container with the runtime dependencies
      var builder = Dependencies.CreateContainer();

      //TODO: add customizations, stubs required for testing

      return builder;
    }
